# React gchessboard + Chess.js demo

A simple chess demo app that uses the [gchessboard](https://github.com/mganjoo/gchessboard) library for the UI and [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js) for gameplay logic.

- Uses [@lit-labs/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit-labs/react) to wrap the `<g-chess-board>` component.
- Uses React hooks and functional components throughout.
- Strongly typed using TypeScript.
- Uses [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
