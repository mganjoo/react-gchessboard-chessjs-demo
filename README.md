# React Chessground + Chess.js demo

A simple chess demo app that uses the [Chessground](https://github.com/ornicar/chessground) library for the UI and [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js) for gameplay logic.

- Uses React hooks and functional components throughout.
- Strongly typed using TypeScript.
- Uses [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
